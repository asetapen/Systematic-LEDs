Please go to https://github.com/LedFx/LedFx for the latest in funky lighting!

Good news! **LedFx is compatable with WLED, and the ESP firmware used by Systematic LEDs AND Scott Lawson's audio-reactive-led-strip.**

LedFx couldn't be simpler to get running if you're a WLED user.

1. Download and install from https://ledfx.app 
2. Run LedFx and your WLED devices will be detected automatically, ready for you to use!

All you have to do is download and install LedFx, add the ESP device(s), and you're good to go :D
